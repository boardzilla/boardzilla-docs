An action is a single move that a player can take. Some actions require choices, sometimes several, before they can be executed. Some don't have any choices, like if a player can simply 'pass'. What defines where one action ends and another begins is how much you as a player can decide before you &quot;commit&quot;. For example, in chess you select a piece to move and then a place to put it. These are a single move, not separate. (Unless playing touch-move, which is rarely done in digital chess.) In hearts, you pass 3 cards to another players. These are a single move, not 3. You can change your mind as you select the cards, rather than have to commit to each one. Similarly, other players do not see any information about your choices until you actually commit the entire move.  This function is called for each action in the game actions you define indefineActions. These actions are initially declared with an optional prompt and condition. Further information is added to the action by chaining methods that add choices and behaviour. See Action.  If this action accepts prior arguments besides the ones chosen by the player during the execution of this action (especially common for followUp actions) then a generic can be added for these arguments to help Typescript type these parameters, e.g.:player =&gt; action&lt;{ cards: number}&gt;(...)  Type parameters​  Name\tTypeA\textends Record&lt;string, Argument&lt;P&gt;&gt; = {}  Parameters​  Name\tType\tDescriptiondefinition\tObject\t- definition.prompt?\tstring\tThe prompt that will appear for the player to explain what the action does. Further prompts can be defined for each choice they subsequently make to complete the action. definition.condition?\tboolean | (args: A) =&gt; boolean\tA boolean or a function returning a boolean that determines whether the action is currently allowed. Note that the choices you define for your action will further determine if the action is allowed. E.g. if you have a play card action and you add a choice for cards in your hand, Boardzilla will automatically disallow this action if there are no cards in your hand based on the face that there are no valid choices to complete the action. You do not need to specify a condition for these types of limitations. If using the function form, the function will receive an object with any arguments passed to this action, e.g. from followUp.

This can be useful to present additional information about the consequences of this choice, or simply to force the player to hit a button with a clear message. This can be a simple string, or a 2-celled array in the same form as message with a string message and a set of key-value pairs for string interpolation, optionally being a function that takes an object of key-value pairs for all player choices up to this point, including this one, and returns the interpolation object. options.validate?\t(args: A &amp; { [key in string]: T | T[] }) =&gt; undefined | string | boolean\tA function that takes an object of key-value pairs for all player choices and returns a boolean. If false, the game will not allow the player to submit this choice. If a string is returned, this will display as the reason for disallowing these selections. options.min?\tundefined\tIf supplied, the choice is for a set of elements and the minimum required is min. options.max?\tundefined\tIf supplied, the choice is for a set of elements and the maximum allowed is max. options.number?\tundefined\tIf supplied, the choice is for a set of exactly number elements. For example, if the player is being asked to pass 3 cards from their hand, the choices should be to the cards in their hand and the number to 3. options.skipIf?\t&quot;always&quot; | &quot;never&quot; | &quot;only-one&quot; | (args: A) =&gt; boolean\tOne of 'always', 'never' or 'only-one' or a function returning a boolean. (Default 'only-one'). - only-one: If there is only valid choice in the choices given, the game will skip this choice, prompting the player for subsequent choices, if any, or completing the action otherwise. - always: Rather than present this choice directly, the player will be prompted with choices from the next choice in the action for each possible choice here, essentially expanding the choices ahead of time to save the player a step. This option only has relevance if there are subsequent choices in the action. - never: Always present this choice, even if the choice is forced - function: A function that accepts all player choices up to this point and returns a boolean. If returning true, this choice will be skipped. This form is useful in the rare situations where the choice at the time may be meaningless, e.g. selecting from a set of identical tokens. In this case the game will make the choice for the player using the first viable option.

This can be accomplished in a number of ways, the simplest beinghideFromAll. There are many other methods for managing visibilty. It may also be that some properties should be visible even when the element is hidden, e.g. a Card may belong to different decks, and this is represented byCard#deck.

These can be done automatically by adding event handlers to spaces. The most common type is to have spaces that change the visibility of their elements. E.g. when a card enters the deck, it should automatically be turned face down. When it enters a player's hand, it becomes visibile only to that player. This can be done with onEnter:  // the deck's cards are always face down $.deck.onEnter(Card, card =&gt; card.hideFromAll(); // the player's hand always reveals their cards to `player` const hand = board.create(Space, 'hand', { player }); hand.onEnter(Card, card =&gt; card.showTo(player));   There is also a corresponding onExit handler.

Even if an action has several different choices, it must be taken altogether or not at all. If a player makes one of the choices but then changes their mind, they can freely cancel the action without an undo, and no other player will be aware of their &quot;partial&quot; action.  Actions are units of choice A chess move as a Boardzilla Action would have two selections: Piece to moveSpace to move it to You can select them each in turn (or both at once by dragging) but you if you select a pawn and change your mind, you can unselect it and select a knight. Selecting the piece by itself does not constitute an action until the destination space is selected.  Each action may contain several selections for the player to make, but they must all be available to the player with the information they have at the time they begin the action. If an action requires more choices as information is revealed, that must be a separate action. (see follow-ups).  Actions are like functions Think of actions like function calls. An action for a chess move would be like a function named move that takes two arguments piece and space. This is a single action, not two.

Let's break it down:  The name of the action is &quot;bid&quot;, defined as the key of the object.Notice that the action function accepts a player argument. This is the player performing this action, which is why later in the action we can refer to the player's money and use their name in the message.This action has one selection which is named &quot;amount&quot;. This is a number selection created with chooseNumber.This action has two behaviour function. One is ado that records the bid amount asboard.lastBid and one is a message sent to the players.This action also has two properties. We've added a string prompt, and also a condition for performing this action, which is that the player must not have been marked as passing this auction.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Selections​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Actions","url":"/game/actions#selections","content":" Selections are individual units of choice for the player. There are 5 fundamental types of selections available in Boardzilla, plus a chooseGroupthat can combine these:  Type\tMethod\tDescription\tAppearancenumber\tchooseNumber\tSelect from a range of numbers, such as when spending an arbitrary amount of resources.\tNumber picker text\tenterText\tEnter text, such as in word-guessing games.\tInput box choices\tchooseFrom\tSelect from a list of choices.\tList of buttons board\tchooseOnBoard\tSelect something on the board, a piece or space\tSelectable elements on the board can be clicked placement\tplacePiece\tSelect the exact position for a piece\tThe selected piece becomes movable and snaps to valid positions group\tchooseGroup\tCombination of any of the selections above\tForm combining the above  Each selection added to an Action must be one of these types, and must have a name unique to this action. The methods above are called one by one, chained onto the action in the order the player must select them. You can think of these methods like Chained Promisesthat are resolved by the choice the player makes. All the values selected by the player become available to function calls later in the action, as a single argument with key-value pairs for the selections. For example:   action({ prompt: &quot;Pick a number and a word&quot; }).chooseNumber( 'amount' }).enterText( 'guess' }).do( ({ amount, guess }) =&gt; { // amount equals the number the player chose // guess equals the text the player entered } );   Because of this, many of the properties of actions can be expressions or functions that return expressions based on the player selections up to that point. Whenever you're working with Boardzilla actions, and a property accepts a function, the function will be called with the player selections up to that point. In fact, often one selection will depend on the choices made in previous selections.  Let's use an example. Suppose the player needs to select a type of resource to purchase and the amount they wish to purchase. The chooseNumber method acceptsmin and max to set the range of allowed values. We might set the max based on the amount available for the resource they chose.   action({ prompt: &quot;Purchase resources&quot; }).chooseFrom( 'resource', ['Lumber', 'Steel', 'Wheat'] ).chooseNumber( 'amount', { min: 1, // here the &quot;resource&quot; chosen is available to limit the range for the 2nd selection max: ({ resource }) =&gt; board.availableResources(resource) } );   Using Typescript for actions Because the choose functions declare the type of selection, Typescript will correctly type these arguments later when you use them. This is useful to double check that you have entered the selections correctly.

For thesecond argument we specify a predetermined location with a literal Space. Both the piece(s) moved, or the location they're moved to, can either be player choices (string names), or predetermined game elements (GameElementexpressions).  Boardzilla will make this move when the player has made all their selctions, and will additionally permit a mouse drag if using a desktop browser.  placing pieces placePiece is a special method that isboth a selection and a behaviour.

The easiest way to do this is by chaining amessage call onto the end of the action. Themessage function takes a string and can interpolate either the player name or any of the items selected by using {{handlebars}}. For example in the play card action above we can add a message like this:   player =&gt; action({ prompt: 'Play a card' }).chooseOnBoard( 'card', player.allMy(Card), ).move( 'card', $.play ).message( &quot;{{player}} played {{card}}&quot; )   We can add other expressions in the message string using concatenation or template literals. We can also add more {{handlebar}} variables using the second argument, e.g.:   .message( &quot;{{player}} played {{card}} and now has a score of {{score}}&quot;, { score: player.score() } )   Using {{handlebars}} It is good to use Boardzilla's {{handlebar}} syntax in messages when referencing Players or Game objects or anything important in the message, as Boardzilla will apply special formatting to this part of the message, appropriate to the item referenced.  Message strings Boardzilla provides string representations of Players and Game Elements that use their &quot;name&quot; using the standard toString(). You are free to override these and provide your own toString() if you want these thing represented with more appropriate strings in messages.

For example, if you have a playCard action that has a selection of any card in the player's hand, if that player has no cards, then playCard will be removed from the list of possible actions. Also if a player has only one card, then Boardzilla will consider that when looking at what actions are possible.  In the example above with choosing &quot;resource&quot; and &quot;amount&quot;, consider what would happen if board.availableResources(&quot;Lumber&quot;) returned 0. In this case,min would be 1 and the max would be 0, an impossible choice. Boardzilla would therefore eliminate &quot;Lumber&quot; from the possible resource to choose from. It's possible that only one resource is selectable, in this case the&quot;resource&quot; selection can be skipped and the player would be prompted only for the &quot;amount&quot; when trying to perform this action.  Skipping forced selections If there is only one possible action to move the game forward, the client will automatically make this move. For example, if a player is presented with options to play cards, use items, or pass, if they have neither cards nor items, then the game will automatically &quot;pass&quot;. This behaviour can be changed using skipIf.  This is called &quot;tree-shaking&quot; the actions and it's a powerful aspect of Boardzilla. This means you can add several possible actions to the list of available actions, even if some of them depend on unusual circumstances. Perhaps an action can only be taken if you have a particular card, or if the game is in a particular phase, etc. Boardzilla will prune the tree of possible actions to present the choices to the player that make sense under the circumstances.

You can also declare that an entire action is impossible based on other reasons by adding a condition to the action. In the example above we set a condition for the &quot;bid&quot; action, which is that the player must have not passed the auction, which was recorded as player.passedThisAuction.

This action must be defined elsewhere in the defineActionscall with this name.  Often a variety of ways to trigger this follow-up will exist in play with variations. Imagine a card game where drawing certain cards lets you take resources of your choice, but different cards let you take different amounts. Rather than define different actions for each amount, we can pass arguments to the follow-up action. The triggering action might look like this:   player =&gt; action({ prompt: 'Play a card' }).chooseOnBoard( 'card', player.allMy(Card), ).move( 'card', $.play ).do( ({ card }) =&gt; { if (card.takeResources &gt; 0) { game.followUp({ name: 'takeResources', amount: card.takeResources }); } } )   In this case the &quot;amount&quot; becomes just another argument in the action named&quot;takeResources&quot; except that instead of being a player selection, this one is passed in. The &quot;takeResources&quot; action then might look something like this:   player =&gt; action&lt;{amount: number}&gt;({ prompt: 'Take resources' }).chooseFrom( 'resource', ['Lumber', 'Steel', 'Wheat'] ).do( ({ resource, amount }) =&gt; player.addResources(resource, amount) )   Note the use of the Typescript generic here &lt;{amount: number}&gt;. This is not required but ensures that Typescript correctly types amount later in the docall since it has no other way of knowing what that argument is.

If unspecified, the entire area is used, i.e. { left: 0, top: 0, width: 100, height: 100 } rows?\tnumber | { min: number ; max?: number } | { min?: number ; max: number }\tThe number of rows to allot for placing elements in this layout. If a number is provided, this is fixed. If min/max values are provided, the layout will allot at least min and up to max as needed. If min is omitted, a minimum of 1 is implied. If max is omitted, as many are used as needed. Default is {min: 1, max: Infinity}. columns?\tnumber | { min: number ; max?: number } | { min?: number ; max: number }\tColumns, as per rows slots?\tBox[]\tIf supplied, this overrides all other attributes to define a set of strictly defined boxes for placing each element. Any elements that exceed the number of slots provided are not displayed. size?\t{ width: number ; height: number }\tSize alloted for each element placed in this layout. Unless scaling is &quot;none&quot;, a size provided here will be used only to define an aspect ratio but may scale up or down to fit as needed. As such, when using any scaling other than &quot;none&quot;, providing an aspectRatio instead is sufficient. size.width\tnumber\t- size.height\tnumber\t- aspectRatio?\tnumber\tAspect ratio for each element placed in this layout. This value is a ratio of width over height. Elements will adhere to this ratio unless they have their own specified aspectRatio in their GameElement#appearance. This value is ignored if size is provided. scaling\t&quot;fit&quot; | &quot;fill&quot; | &quot;none&quot;\tScaling strategy for the elements placed in this layout. - none: Elements use the size value and do not scale. If no size is provided, this behaves like fit (default) - fit: Elements scale up or down to fit within the area alloted without squshing - fill: Elements scale up or down to completely fill the area, squishing themselves together as needed along one dimension. gap?\tnumber | { x: number ; y: number }\tIf provided, this places a gap between elements. If scaling is 'fill', this is considered a maximum but may shrink or even become negative in order to fill the area. This value is an absolute percentage of the board's size so that gaps specified on different layouts with the same value will exactly match alignment\t&quot;top&quot; | &quot;bottom&quot; | &quot;left&quot; | &quot;right&quot; | &quot;top left&quot; | &quot;bottom left&quot; | &quot;top right&quot; | &quot;bottom right&quot; | &quot;center&quot;\tIf more room is provided than needed, this determines how the elements will align themselves within the area. offsetColumn?\tVector\tInstead of gap, providing an offsetColumn/offsetRow specifies that the contained elements must offset one another by a specified amount as a percentage of the elements size, i.e. offsetColumn=100 is equivalent to a gap of 0. This allows non-orthogonal grids like hex or diamond. If one of offsetColumn/offsetRow is provided but not the other, the unspecified one will be 90° to the one specified. Like gap, if scaling is set to fill, these offsets may squish to fill space. offsetRow?\tVector\tAs offsetColumn direction\t&quot;square&quot; | &quot;ltr&quot; | &quot;rtl&quot; | &quot;rtl-btt&quot; | &quot;ltr-btt&quot; | &quot;ttb&quot; | &quot;ttb-rtl&quot; | &quot;btt&quot; | &quot;btt-rtl&quot;\tSpecifies the direction in which elements placed here should fill up the rows and columns of the layout. Rows or columns will increase to their specified maximum as needed. Therefore if, for example, direction is &quot;ltr&quot; and columns has no maximum, there will never be a second row added. Values are: - square: fill rows and columns equally to maintain as square a grid as possible (default) - ltr: fill columns left to right, then rows top to bottom once maximum columns reached - rtl: fill columns right to left, then rows top to bottom once maximum columns reached - ltr-btt: fill columns left to right, then rows bottom to top once maximum columns reached - rtl-btt: fill columns right to left, then rows bottom to top once maximum columns reached - ttb: fill rows top to bottom, then columns left to right once maximum rows reached - btt: fill rows bottom to top, then columns left to right once maximum rows reached - ttb-rtl: fill rows top to bottom, then columns right to left once maximum rows reached - btt-rtl: fill rows bottom to top, then columns right to left once maximum rows reached limit?\tnumber\tIf specified, no more than limit items will be visible. This is useful for displaying e.g. decks of cards where showing only 2 or 3 cards provides a deck-like appearance without needed to render more cards underneath that aren't visible. maxOverlap?\tnumber\tIf scaling is &quot;fill&quot;, this will limit the total amount of overlap if elements are squished together in their space before they will start to shrink to fit. This is useful for e.g. cards that can overlap but that must leave a certain amount visible to clearly identify the card. haphazardly?\tnumber\tA number specifying an amount of randomness added to the layout to provide a more natural looking placement sticky?\tboolean\tSet to true to prevent these elements from automatically changing position within the container grid. showBoundingBox?\tstring\tSet to true for debugging. Creates a visible box on screen around the defined area, tagged with the provided string. drawer?\t{ closeDirection: &quot;up&quot; | &quot;down&quot; | &quot;left&quot; | &quot;right&quot; ; tab: (el: T) =&gt; React.ReactNode | false ; closedTab?: (el: T) =&gt; React.ReactNode | false ; openIf?: (actions: { name: string ; args: Record&lt;string, Argument&lt;Player&gt;&gt; }[]) =&gt; boolean ; closeIf?: (actions: { name: string ; args: Record&lt;string, Argument&lt;Player&gt;&gt; }[]) =&gt; boolean }\tSpecifies that this layout should inhabit a drawer, a collapsible area that can be hidden to save overall space on the board. drawer.closeDirection\t&quot;up&quot; | &quot;down&quot; | &quot;left&quot; | &quot;right&quot;\t- drawer.tab\t(el: T) =&gt; React.ReactNode | false\tJSX to appear in the tab while open drawer.closedTab?\t(el: T) =&gt; React.ReactNode | false\tJSX to appear in the tab while closed, if it differs from the open appearance drawer.openIf?\t(actions: { name: string ; args: Record&lt;string, Argument&lt;Player&gt;&gt; }[]) =&gt; boolean\tA function that will be checked at each game state.

The arguments to this function are the steps for your game. There are two basic types of steps:  a functiona flow command  Let's look at a simple example from the Boardzilla starter game:   game.defineFlow( () =&gt; $.pool.shuffle(), loop( eachPlayer({ name: 'player', do: playerActions({ actions: ['take'] }), }) ) );   This flow contains exactly two items: a function call that shuffles the pool, and the main play loop. The first function makes a single change to the board:   () =&gt; $.pool.shuffle(),   Generally the first function of a flow will set up the board, shuffling decks, dealing out opening hands and the like. Later in the flow you can use functions as much as you like to make other changes to the board state, including moving pieces around that are not part of a player action (e.g. dealing out a new hand) or just changing state on the board or players (e.g. updating the score).  Flow may not create or destroy game elements One thing you cannot do in the flow is create new elements. All Spaces and Pieces your game needs must be created before callingdefineFlow. If pieces are only needed later in the game, they can be created on the pile using board.pile.create().  The next argument in this example calls loop. This is a basic flow command that causes a portion of the flow to be repeated until something interupts it. In this case, it sets up the basic game loop. Flow commands can set up other types of loops, have players take turns, create branching logic, and most importantly, prompt players for the actions they can perform.  In the example above the main loop itself includes other flow commands, namelyeachPlayer and playerActions. This is an important distinction between the two types of flow steps, functions and flow commands:  Flow commands can only be included by other flow commands.  For example, imagine you have a flow function that does some things, setting up the deck, dealing some cards, and then cleaning after the hand:   game.defineFlow( () =&gt; { // shuffle the deck // deal cards // put the cards back in the deck }) );   If you now want to insert a flow command in the middle to add a player action, you must break the function into two pieces and insert the flow function between them, e.g.:   game.defineFlow( () =&gt; { // shuffle the deck // deal cards }, playerAction({ actions: ['playCard'] }), () =&gt; { // put the cards back in the deck }) );   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Flow commands​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Flow","url":"/game/flow#flow-commands","content":" All flow commands are available ongame.flowCommands. It is common to deconstruct all needed commands before defining flow, i.e.:   const { playerActions, eachPlayer, forEach, forLoop, } = game.flowCommands;   Let's look at the various flow commands. There are 3 main types of flow commands, looping, branching and actions.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Looping flow commands​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Flow","url":"/game/flow#looping-flow-commands","content":" loop​  The most basic loop, this creates a loop that continues indefinitely until explicitly interupted. This would be like a C/Javascript while(true).  whileLoop​  Like the basic loop, except that it accepts a condition and will only start a new iteration of the loop if the condition is true. This is exaclty like the C/Javascript while(condition). In particular, note that this loop may never execute even a single iteration if the supplied condition is false to begin with.  forLoop​  This loop sets a value, iterates that value at each loop iteration and continues looping until that value meets some condition. In other words, a standard forloop from C/Javascript.  forEach​  This loop accepts a collection, and iterates over the members of that collection. This is like for ... of or Array#forEach in Javascript.  eachPlayer​  This is a loop that iterates over each player. This is the same as forEachwith the additional behaviour that it sets the the &quot;current&quot; player on each iteration of the loop.  everyPlayer​  Strictly speaking, this does not create a loop at all. It looks identical toeachPlayer above except that instead of taking each iteration for each player in turn, it let's all players take they turn simultaneously in parallel. This &quot;loop&quot; completes when all players have completed the body of the loop, or when the loop is otherwise interrupted.

It may also execute a default branch if no other matches apply. This is similar to theswitch...case in C/Javascript but without fall through behaviour.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Player Actions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Flow","url":"/game/flow#player-actions","content":" playerActions​  The sole flow command for prompting player actions. This command accept a list of allowed actions that were defined in defineActions and prompts the current player (or a particular player or players if specified).  Note that like all other selections in Boardzilla, this list of actions hastree-shaking and skipping behaviour. If one of the included actions is determined to have possible valid moves, it will not be included in player prompts. If only one of the supplied actions is determined to be playable, it will be prompted. If such an action requires no further prompts it will be auto-played. Just like action selections this behaviour can be configured for each playerActions with a skipIf parameter.  For this reason, it is common to include a wide variety of possible actions in the list of playerActions but let each action definition take responsibility for determining whether it is actually playable at the time based on its selections and/or condition parameter.  flow commands are created once Unlike Actions that are created for each player at the time of being played, flow commands are created at the beginning of the game. Be careful with passing expressions directly to Flow commands that rely on game state. For example if you want to loop through some cards laid out in a board Space called &quot;field&quot;, something like the following is probably not what you want: forEach({ name: 'card', collection: deck.all(Card), // only evaluated at the start of the game do: playerAction({ actions: ['chooseCard', 'pass'] }) }) Instead use the functional form, so that the expression will be evaluated each time this loop is entered: forEach({ name: 'card', collection: () =&gt; deck.all(Card), do: playerAction({ actions: ['chooseCard', 'pass'] }) })   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Current Flow Position​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Flow","url":"/game/flow#current-flow-position","content":" For many flow commands, it is necessary to know what the current position is. For example in a simple for i loop, we need to access i and have logic that depends on its current value.  Basically all function parameters in flow commands accept a single argument of type FlowArguments for this purpose. The argument is a single object that contains all values &quot;in scope&quot; at this point in the flow. There are two types of values included here:  loop variablesplayer action selections  Loop variables​  The loop variables included here are from any loops that the flow is currently inside of, namely the current iterator value in any forLoops, the current collection member of any forEach loops, the evaluated test expression in any switchCases.  The values are included as key value pairs where the key is the name parameter supplied for the flow command.   forLoop({ name: 'x', // x is declared here initial: 0, next: x =&gt; x + 1, while: x =&gt; x &lt; 3, do: forLoop({ name: 'y', // y is declared here initial: 0, next: y =&gt; y + 1, while: y =&gt; y &lt; 2, do: ({ x, y }) =&gt; { // x is available here as the value of the outer loop // and y will be the value of the inner loop } }) })   Player action selections​  For player action selections, the arguments to the player action are included as a single object. Again this only applies if the flow command is inside the branch belonging to this player action. The name in this case is the name of the actions. For example, here we have defined an action called &quot;takeResource&quot; and later we want to know what choices the player made in the flow.   game.defineActions({ ... takeResources: player =&gt; action&lt;{amount: number}&gt;({ prompt: 'Take resources' }).chooseFrom( 'resource', ['Lumber', 'Steel', 'Wheat'] ).do( ({ resource, amount }) =&gt; player.addResources(resource, amount) ) ... }); game.defineFlow( ... playerActions({ actions: [ { name: 'takeResources', do: ({ takeResources }) =&gt; { // takeResoures.resource will be the name of the resource, e.g. 'Steel' // takeResoures.amount will be the selection number &quot;amount&quot; } } ] }) );   Action vs playerActions We can react to a player's action both in the actiondo and in the do of the playerActions. It can be confusing which we should use for what. In general the action do is the proper place to react to what a player just did. This includes mutating the board, recording state, or triggering follow-up actions. The playerActions do should be used only if the player action changes the flow of the game, e.g. ending a phase or somehow interrupting a loop, or triggering other rounds of player actions, since flow commands can only be issued inside other flow commands.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Loop interuption​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Flow","url":"/game/flow#loop-interuption","content":" It is important in a game to able to interrupt loops. In fact if we use the basic loop flow command, the loop will continue indefinitely unless we interrupt it. There are 3 basic loop interruption functions:  Do.break()  This causes the flow to exit loop and resume after the loop, like thebreak keyword in C/Javascript.  Do.continue()  This causes the flow to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and restart the loop at the next iteration, like the continue keyword in C/Javascript.  Do.repeat()  Similar to Do.continue except this restarts the loop on the same iterationit's currently on.  These functions can be called in any loop function or action. Often it is the only thing you want to call after a particular action, in which case you can pass it as the action do, e.g.:   loop(playerActions({ actions: [ 'takeOneFromBag', { name: 'done', // break out of the loop when a player selects 'Done' do: Do.break } ] }));   These are not javascript keywords Remember that the flow interuption functions are merely humble Javascript functions, not keywords, despite being named similarly. They do not break control flow all by themselves. loop({ name: 'round', do: () =&gt; { if (game.isRoundFinished()) Do.break(); // otherwise do other stuff game.doOtherStuff(); &lt;-- will execute even if Do.break is called } }); Use e.g. return or else to control what executes, e.g.: loop({ name: 'round', do: () =&gt; { if (game.isRoundFinished()) return Do.break(); // otherwise do other stuff game.doOtherStuff(); } });  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
