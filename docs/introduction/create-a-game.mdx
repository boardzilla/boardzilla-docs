# Creating your first game

Once you've installed the devtools and Node 18 or high, you're ready to create your first game. To do so, run the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Mac OS/Linux" label="Mac OS/Linux">

```console
bz new
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">

```console
bz.exe new
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll be guided through a series of prompts. One of the choices you'll be prompted with is which game template you'd like to use. The **[simple template](https://github.com/boardzilla/boardzilla-starter-game)** gives you a very basic game to edit right away. The **[empty template](https://github.com/boardzilla/boardzilla-empty-game)** gives you a completely empty game to use. If this is your first time making a game, the simple template is probably best as it gives you a working example to play with.
