# Creating a game

## Before you get started

In order to make a game in Boardzilla you'll need to have:

- [Node 18 or higher](https://nodejs.org/)
- A Linux or Mac environment to develop on
- A code editor of your choice

As well, a knowledge of the following is essential to writing a game in Boardzilla:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

As well, some familiarity with the following is useful:

- [React](https://react.dev/), particularly with [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)
- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) which is used to compile and build your game

## Creating your first game

Once you've got Node 18 or higher installed, you're ready to create your first game. Run the following:

```console
npx @boardzilla/create-game
```

You'll be guided through a series of prompts. One of the choices you'll be prompted with is which game template you'd like to use. The **[simple template](https://github.com/boardzilla/boardzilla-starter-game)** gives you a very basic game to edit right away. The **[empty template](https://github.com/boardzilla/boardzilla-empty-game)** gives you a completely empty game to use. If this is your first time making a game, the simple template is probably best as it gives you a working example to play with.
