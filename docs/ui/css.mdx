# CSS

Boardzilla can be entirely customized through standard CSS. By default many
styles are included basic positioning and animation that are not intended to
change. However all Boardzilla CSS is applied using a CSS `@layer` so that any
CSS you provide will override these.

## DOM element reference

Here you will find a list of all the elements and classes that can be targetted
for custom CSS. As with any CSS development, it is often best to simply inspect
the HTML and edit it directly to see what effect your custom CSS will have.

This HTML block is only intended to show the general structure and where
examples of the main types of elements would appear in the DOM. This is not
exhaustive and not all of these elements would be present at the same time.

<pre>

:::tip use em or %

Since elements in Boardzilla can change size, it's important to never use
absolute CSS units like `px`.

Always use `em` units when you want your CSS to be relative to the element it
belongs to. CSS attributes that accept a `%` relative to parent size are also
appropriate. Use `rem`s in cases where you want the size to be relative to
the entire game board.

:::

### &lt;html&gt;

The html element is where dark-mode is set. To target dark mode with specific CSS, use 
```css
html.dark {
```

### &lt;body&gt;

The body element is typically targetted only for global CSS changes, like `font-family`.

### #setup

The game setup page with seating and settings is found here. Target this with
CSS if you want to style the setup page specifically, e.g. with custom font
treatment.

### #game
The top-level element for the game itself. This can have a variety of classes
applied to it to target particular browsers and devices, namely:
- `mobile` for mobile browsers
- `desktop` for desktop browsers
- `browser-chrome` for Chrome
- `browser-edge` for Edge
- `browser-safari` for Safari
- `browser-firefox` for Firefox


### #background

The background element that contains the wood grain. This can be replaced or
customized by changing `background-image`

### #play-area

The Board is rendered here, as opposed to any player controls or informational
text. Use this in case of CSS selectors that must be scoped to the board
only. Remember that elements can appear in modals so element CSS should not be
restricted to `#play-area`.

### .transform-wrapper

Every Space or Piece has a Wrapper div around it that Boardzilla uses for
positioning, scaling and animations. Generally, it is inadvisable to target this
directly with CSS. This element has `font-size` set to a value that scales with
the size of the element. This means that any CSS applied to the element can use
`em` units to ensure it stays proportionate to the element.

### .Space or .Piece

Specific Spaces and Pieces of your board are rendered with this element. They
always a class name of `Space` or `Piece` depending on the base type. They also
have a class name matching the Typescript class of the element if it is
subclassed.

There are additional class names that may be present depending on circumstances,
and are useful for targetting to customize appearance:

- `selected` If this element is selected
- `selectable` If this element is currently selectable in an available action
- `droppable` If this element is a valid drop zone for a dragged element
- `clickable` If this element is clickable for any reason
- `invalid` If this element is an invalid selection due to a `validate` rule

The properties you give to your Space/Piece class, as well as built-in
properties like `name` and `player` are also added to the HTML element as `data-`
attributes, e.g.:

```html
  <div
    class="Piece Card"
    data-name="ace-of-hearts"
    data-suit="H"
    data-number="1"
  >
```

All JSX supplied in the [`appearance.render`](appearance#render) appears
immediately inside this element.

Also see [appearance](appearance#css).

### .profile-badge

The &lt;ProfileBadge&gt; component, if it is included on the page, appears here,
along with children for the avatar image and the player name. This can be
targetted to customize font treatment, but should generally be left with little
alteration for consistency's sake. This element additionally may have these
classes:

- `online` if the player is currently online
- `current` if the player is the [current player](../game/players#current-player) to act

### .player-controls

Any player input controls or prompts that sit on top of the page are here. They
may include prompt text, with class name `prompt`. Additionally specific player
controls can be targeted by using the the name of the [Flow
command](../game/flow#flow-commands). If a name is present this element will
additionally have a class name for that step:

```css
.player-controls.step-<step name> {
```

### .modal-popup

This class applies to all popup modals, whether they be information modals,
annoucements or the "game finished" annoucement.

### #announcement

The announcement modal. This includes the "game finished" announcement.

### #info-drawer

The floating info panel in the top left once it's opened. This can be targetted
for font and color treatment. For consistency's sake, styling should remain
close to default.

### #info-modal

The floating info modal that appears when clicking on an information sidebar
item or a game element with more info.

When selecting an element to see info, this modal contains the element in its
`.element-zoom` child div. It is important to remember that an element's
[`appearance.render`](appearance#render) JSX can appear in this context as well
so CSS styles applied to elements must allow for this hierarchy, being
completely outside the [#play-area](#play-area).

## CSS Variables

There are a few CSS variables set for convenience to access player's chosen
colors. These are set on the `#game` or on the relevant `.Space` or `.Piece`
element so that they cascade down to any relevant child elements:

- `--player-color`: the color of the owner player for this element
- `--my-player-color`: the color of the player viewing the game
- `--current-player-color`: the color of the player who's turn it currently is,
  provided only a single player can act.

## Hover

Applying CSS to elements as players hover them can be done with the standard
`:hover` pseudo-class on the Piece/Space element.

It is common in the case of stacked elements to have elements next to the
hovered element splay out to reveal themselves to make it easy to leaf thru the
stack. A standard, although somewhat complex CSS selector can be used to select
the elements before and after the hover, e.g.:

```css
  .transform-wrapper:has(+ .transform-wrapper .Card:hover) .Card {
    /* the card before the hover */
  }

  .transform-wrapper:has(.Card:hover) + .transform-wrapper .Card {
    /* the card after the hover */
  }
```

This can be further extended with even more esoteric CSS:

```css
  .transform-wrapper:has(+ .transform-wrapper + .transform-wrapper .Card:hover) .Card {
    /* two cards before the hover */
  }
  .transform-wrapper:has(.Card:hover) + .transform-wrapper + .transform-wrapper .Card {
    /* two cards after the hover */
  }
```
