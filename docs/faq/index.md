# FAQ

## Who owns my games?

You do! You own the copyright for any game you make.

## If I make my game available on boardzilla.io, do I need publish the source as well?

If your game uses the `@boardzilla/core` library, and no other AGPL licensed software, you do not need to publish the game source code.

## Can I monetize my game?

You can do anything the AGPL provides, including monetizing it however you'd like.

## What If I want to monetize my game but not publish the source code?

If you'd like to do, you're probably interested in a license other than the AGPL. Please contact us at info@boardzilla.io to arrange for an alternate license.

## What if i want to improve `@boardzilla/core` on my own?
