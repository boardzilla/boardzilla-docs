# Publishing

To submit a game to Boardzilla.io, you can now use the `submit` command in your package.json. This command will package your game, upload your assets and create an unpublished game on Boardzilla.io. If you haven't already done so, you'll be prompted to create an account and login.

## Assets for your game

Your new game requires some metadata and assets before it can be published. Once you've submitted your game you'll be directed to a page on boardzilla.io to finish game submission. Write here once this process is cleaned up.
